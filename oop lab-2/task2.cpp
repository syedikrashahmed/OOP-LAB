/*Task 2
Write a C++ program that:
 Reads n strings from the user and stores them in a dynamically allocated array of char*.
 Prints the strings in reverse order using pointer arithmetic.
 Finds and prints the string with the most vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
 Calculates and prints the average length of all the strings.
Note: Use pointer notation wherever possible.
If there are multiple strings with the same number of vowels, print the first one encountered*/
